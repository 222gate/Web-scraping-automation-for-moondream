Rendered images: You might want to standardize the method of capturing these images across all websites. This will ensure consistency and make it easier when analyzing the data later. Consider using headless browsers such as Puppeteer or Playwright to programmatically take screenshots.
Accessibility trees and bounding boxes: Accessibility tree information can usually be obtained through browser developer tools APIs or by leveraging existing libraries that provide this functionality. For instance, in Puppeteer, you can use page.accessibility to interact with the accessibility tree. Keep in mind that not all websites may have properly implemented accessibility features, so having fallback data like the DOM structure could indeed be helpful.
Scalability: Collecting data from half a million websites is no small feat. To accomplish this task efficiently, consider parallelizing your data collection process. Use multiple instances of your scraper running concurrently while being mindful of web server load and any potential impact on target sites. Also, keep track of rate limits imposed by websites to avoid overloading their servers.
Data storage: With large datasets comes the need for efficient and scalable data storage solutions. Depending on your budget, infrastructure, and technical expertise, you might opt for SQL databases, NoSQL databases, distributed file systems, object stores, or cloud services tailored for storing big data. Make sure to design your schema carefully to optimize query performance and minimize disk space usage.
Privacy concerns: When dealing with vast amounts of user data, privacy becomes paramount. Ensure that personally identifiable information (PII) isn't included in your dataset and adhere to ethical guidelines during data collection. If possible, anonymize IP addresses or other potentially sensitive information before storing them.
Legal implications: Be aware of legal restrictions regarding web scraping. Some websites explicitly disallow scraping activities in their terms of service. In cases of doubt, seek explicit permission from website owners before proceeding.
Resilience and error handling: Develop robust error handling mechanisms within your crawler to account for unexpected issues like network failures, timeouts, or changes in targeted websites' structures. Monitor logs regularly to identify patterns and improve overall system reliability.
